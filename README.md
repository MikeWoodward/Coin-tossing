# Coin-tossing
Some code to model coin tossing and present real coin tossing data. This code is in support of a post on my blog: https://blog.engora.com/ I know this is simple stuff, so don't take it too seriously!

Kerrich - code to visualize Kerrich's coin tossing data

Berkeley - code to visualize the Berkeley coin tossing data

coin-simulator - code to simulate coin tossing built with Bokeh. To run the code, type in "bokeh serve --show coin_simulator"
